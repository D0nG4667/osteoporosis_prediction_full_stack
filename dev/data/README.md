# ü©∫ Osteoporosis Prediction Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is a **modified version of a publicly available medical dataset** curated for educational and research purposes related to **osteoporosis risk prediction**.
It contains anonymized patient-level health, lifestyle, and clinical attributes relevant to bone density and fracture risk assessment.
All personal identifiers have been removed to maintain confidentiality and compliance with ethical data use standards.

### üí° Usage

This dataset is intended for **predictive modeling and analysis** of osteoporosis risk using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting.
It supports feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation focused on understanding the relationship between lifestyle, hormonal, and medical factors with bone health outcomes.
